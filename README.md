# Mastering Micro-Frontends: Advanced Tutorial with Module Federation and Vite

Welcome to the advanced tutorial on **Mastering Micro-Frontends** using **Module Federation** and **Vite**. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to build scalable and maintainable web applications by integrating micro-frontends with Vite and Module Federation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Micro-Frontends**: Learn how to break down a monolithic frontend application into smaller, independently deployable micro-frontends.
- **Module Federation**: Understand how Webpack's Module Federation feature allows dynamic loading of micro-frontends, enabling them to share code seamlessly.
- **Vite Integration**: Utilize Vite for its fast development server and optimized build process, ideal for modern web development.

## 📝 Introduction

In modern frontend development, building large-scale applications with multiple teams can be challenging. Micro-frontends offer a solution by allowing teams to build, deploy, and maintain individual features independently. This tutorial demonstrates how to implement micro-frontends in a real-world project using **Module Federation** from Webpack and the ultra-fast build tool **Vite**.

## 🚧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>= v14.x)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Vite** (installation instructions [here](https://vitejs.dev/))

You'll also need some familiarity with **JavaScript**, **Webpack**, and **React** (or your framework of choice).

## ⚡ Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/micro-frontends-vite-module-federation.git
cd micro-frontends-vite-module-federation
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and your application should be available at http://localhost:3000.
